My name is Mika Grootenboer,
Iâ€™m 20 years and currently a third-year Computer Science student at the university of Rotterdam.
In my first two years I mainly focused on working with C# and Python. During this time, I worked on multiple small projects given by our university and learned to work in small teams. After these two years I started mine internship at a small DevOps team and was surprised by the amount of joy I had working with people and learning new information. During this internship I found out that I wanted to know more about the safety of applications and decided to follow the Minor Security.
