BugBot is a hardware-based reconnaissance tool controlled from a central server, to be used by pentesters during physical security assessments. The main use case for this product is as an implant that is dropped during physical security assessments or red team exercises, so the pentester has a gateway into the network without having to setup a phishing operation and having to rely on human error. Itâ€™s goal is to automate several often used reconnaissance tools used during these assessments, so the user is able to spend their precious time on finding vulnerabilities instead of running these tools.

BugBot is a product that has been created with a group of students during the Security Lab Minor at Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences.
